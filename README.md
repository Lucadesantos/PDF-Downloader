# PDF-Downloader
A chromium extension that automatically downloads PDF from a page's source.

## Usage
Used to download PDF from websites where the "download" button is usually behind a paywall (research papers, etc).

## Limitations
Since manifest version 2 is deprecated, this project needs rework.
